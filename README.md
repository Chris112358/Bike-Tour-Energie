# Bike-Tour-Energie
Script to let you see the energie and calories you used on a bike tour
## Description
To use this script you need data in gpx format.
The script was programmed to fit the data given from [komoot](https://komoot.com)
You may change this to fit your conditions, but you need data of time, place in longitude and latitude, and the height

## Installation
Just download or clone the repository.
You than can run it on its own.
## Usage
change the path in the file to your own .gpx file to use it. 
Than change the weight variable to weight of you and your bicicle

## Project status
This is still under Development. I will try to put it on a server, so you can see all your tours on one site.
